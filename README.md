This application is made using flutter 1.22.5. It runs on both android (API level 19 or above) and iOS (current versions are supported).

At the root you'll find a folder called "APK". Inside you'll find two APK files. One release build and one debug build.

To build this app you will need to have flutter SDK installed on your computer (Version 1.22.5 should work).
